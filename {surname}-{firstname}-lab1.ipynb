    "1. It is very important that your entire program is contained within a function. It is also very important that your output value is **returned** and not merely printed. This is to make sure that the function, when called, actually evaluates to a value instead of merely printing the calculated value out to the terminal. This is because the function, conceptually, is intended to be a utility function for further conversions, so it needs to evaluate to a value on its own.\n",
    "2. The function must accept the input through one parameter called `dollars`.\n",
    "3. The function must return a string that is formatted as follows: `{dollars} US dollar(s) = {pesos} Philippine pesos.`, where `dollars` is the amount of dollars given as input and where `pesos` is the equivalent amount of pesos for the given dollars. \n",
